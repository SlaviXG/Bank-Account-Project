# Bank Account Project

<!-- ![Bank Account Project](project_image.png) -->

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Bank Account Project! This project is a demonstration of my coding abilities using Kotlin to create a bank account application. It showcases proficiency in Kotlin programming fundamentals and my ability to apply them effectively in a real-world scenario.

### Key Features

- Create different types of bank accounts: credit, debit, and checking.
- Validate user input to ensure accuracy and prevent errors.
- Check account balances to keep track of available funds.
- Process deposits and withdrawals accurately and securely.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three parts, each building upon the previous one:

### Part 1: Build the Visual User Interface (UI) and Set Up Accounts

In this part, I have developed an intuitive user interface that enables users to select their desired account type. Using loops and when expressions, I ensure the smooth creation of bank accounts based on user input.

### Part 2: Define Bank Account Operations

For each account type, I have implemented the necessary logic to handle deposit and withdrawal operations. By utilizing functions and conditional statements, I ensure that the operations are performed accurately based on the specific account type.

### Part 3: Manage the Bank Account

Once the accounts are created and operations defined, I have implemented the functionality to manage the bank accounts. Users can conveniently perform money withdrawals and deposits, process multiple user commands, and securely handle money transfers.

## Skills Gained

Through this project, I have strengthened my understanding and proficiency in the following Kotlin programming fundamentals:

- Designing and developing a well-structured and modular project.
- Applying object-oriented principles and concepts.
- Implementing user input validation for enhanced reliability.
- Demonstrating good coding practices and maintainability.
- Complying with Kotlin functions, loops, conditional statements, when expressions.

## Getting Started

To run the Bank Account Project, please make sure that Kotlin is installed on your device, then clone the repository, select Bank-Account-Project as a project folder in the IDE and make the Main.kt file to be a starting point to the application. Then run the application.

## Conclusion

The Bank Account Project serves as a testament to my knowledge and skills in Kotlin programming. It reflects my ability to create functional and efficient code, handle user input, and build robust applications. I am proud of the skills I have developed and I am excited to apply them to future projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
