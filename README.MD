# Bank Account Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Bank Account Project! This project is a demonstration of my coding abilities using Kotlin to create a bank account application. It showcases proficiency in Kotlin programming fundamentals and my ability to apply them effectively in a real-world scenario.

### Key Features

- Create different types of bank accounts: credit, debit, and checking.
- Validate user input to ensure accuracy and prevent errors.
- Check account balances to keep track of available funds.
- Process deposits and withdrawals accurately and securely.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three parts, each building upon the previous one:

### Part 1: Build the Visual User Interface (UI) and Set Up Accounts

In this part, I have developed an intuitive user interface that enables users to select their desired account type. Using loops and when expressions, I ensure the smooth creation of bank accounts based on user input.

### Part 2: Define Bank Account Operations

For each account type (Checking, Debit and Credit), I have implemented the necessary logic to handle deposit and withdrawal operations. By utilizing functions and conditional statements, I ensure that the operations are performed accurately based on the specific account type.

### Part 3: Manage the Bank Account

Once the accounts are created and operations defined, I have implemented the functionality to manage the bank accounts. Users can conveniently perform money withdrawals and deposits, process multiple user commands, and securely handle money transfers.

## Skills Gained

Through this project, I have strengthened my understanding and proficiency in the following Kotlin programming fundamentals:

- Designing and developing a well-structured and modular project.
- Applying object-oriented principles and concepts.
- Implementing user input validation for enhanced reliability.
- Demonstrating good coding practices and maintainability.
- Complying with Kotlin functions, loops, conditional statements, when expressions.
- Implementing and executing Unit Tests using JUnit to ensure robust application.
- Working with GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI).

## Getting Started

To run the Bank Account Project, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Kotlin is installed on your device. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA), and select 'Bank-Account-Project' as a project folder.

4. Set the 'Main.kt' file as the starting point of the application.

5. To run the application, execute the 'Main.kt' file.

### Running Unit Tests

This project uses JUnit for unit testing. Follow these steps to run the tests:

1. In your IDE, find the 'test' directory in the project structure.

2. Inside the 'test' directory, you'll find multiple .kt files with unit tests for the different components of the application.

3. To run all the tests simultaneously, right-click on the 'test' directory and select 'Run Tests' (or equivalent, depending on your IDE).

4. To run a specific test, open the respective .kt file, right-click on the test function and select 'Run Test' (or equivalent).

These unit tests help to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application by testing each function individually, allowing you to catch and resolve potential errors early in the development process.

## Conclusion

The Bank Account Project serves as a testament to my knowledge and skills in Kotlin programming. It reflects my ability to create functional and efficient code, handle user input, and build robust applications. I am proud of the skills I have developed and I am excited to apply them to future projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
